# Scenario 

Within this chapter developmental plasticity was explored within _Acanthochromis polyacanthus_ that were collected from two different regions (i.e., low-latitude, Cairns, and high-latitude, Mackay). Fish were held in common garden experiments at 28.5 C. Clutch data was collected along with parental morphometeric data to determine how fish from each population performed at 28.5 C, a temperature that was shown to produce similar absoluate aerobic scope performances in a previous study [link]. Once hatched offspring were placed into three different temperature treatments, 28.5, 30, and 31.5 C. After approximately 5-6 months offspring length and weight was measured, as well as CTmax and respiration during CTmax trials.

# Model fit {.tabset}

Great lets start to fit our models. There are number of variables within our data frame some of which may or may not be important. To investigate which variables are important and which are not will test different hypotheses that use different combinations of variables that are suited to answer reasonable hypotheses. 

From out exploratory data analysis we can see that due to the upwards infliction within the data as fish approach CTmax we will likely need to apply a second order polynomial function to out temperature covariate. Due to the large sample size we have we will also explore how will General Additive Models can be used to model our data. 

We will start out by testing two different hypotheses. 

1. The first hypothesis that will be tested will be the base model that includes covariates that are essential to the question we are asking, are there regional differences in developmental plasticity within _Acanthchormis polyacanthus_ juveniles? To answer this question we will include a three-way interaction including **region** * **dev.temp** * **Temperature**, as well as the covariate **cMASS**, that stands for centered mass values, because we know that mass influences oxygen uptake. 

```{r model1-definition, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
rate.output2 ~ region*dev.temp*poly(Temperature, 2) + cMASS
``` 

2. The second hypothesis will be similar to the base model but will include covariates that are associated with the systems that fish were tested on. Covariates will include **chamber** and **system**. By exploring this model we can make sure that the position that chambers were placed in the tanks did not influence oxygen consumption and that the two seems used, labelled DELL and ASUS from the computers that were used to collect data, produced comparable data. 

```{r model1-definition, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
rate.output2 ~ region*dev.temp*poly(Temperature, 2) + cMASS + chamber + system
``` 

## Base model 

```{r base model, cache=TRUE}
model1 <- brm(rate.output2 ~ region*dev.temp*poly(Temperature, 2) + cMASS, 
              family=gaussian(), 
              data=lat_resp_dat2,

              control = list(adapt_delta=0.95))
